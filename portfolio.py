Over the years, I have developed expertise in programming languages, game development, and electronics. As a K12 instructor, I have had the opportunity to teach various subjects, including circuit building and micro-controller programming, on behalf of a technical college focused on STEM higher education. In this portfolio, you will find a collection of my projects, ranging from simple circuits to complex software programs, that showcase my technical skills and creativity. I hope that this portfolio serves as an inspiration for young students and aspiring engineers, and that it highlights the exciting possibilities of pursuing a career in electrical and software engineering."
